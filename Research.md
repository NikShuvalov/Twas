Authors and Stakeholders:

Date: 12/15/16

Background:
There are many social media apps out there, but what all of them, at least out of the major ones, lack, is allowing users to share profiles based on proximity. Some apps, such as happn have emulated using proximity by actually using your previous locations in the behind the scenes and comparing that to other users previous locations. The only true proximity based social sharing actually comes from Nintendo’s 3DS, but even that has limitations in that after sharing a profile there’s no room for further interaction.

Goals:
Develop an app that:
Allows users to find out more about users around them based on proximity.
Allows users to message nearby users without needing to communicate through a server (offline).
Allows users to interact through a server when they are no longer in proximity of each other.

Research Questions:
Are people willing to broadcast their profile information to anyone that happens to be nearby?
Are people even interested in finding out more about the people they see every day on the train or bus?

-User Personas-

Persona 1: 
Name: Steve
Occupation: Varied
Personality type:Type-A Mixed (Introvert/Extravert)

Steve is a bit of a nomad. He moves from location to location, never living in the same area for too long. On top of that he picks up new jobs as often as he moves. 
Steve steers away from social media for the same reason he moves around so often; he gets a chance to re-invent himself. Also, Facebook is too revealing of his past.
Despite his wanderlust and want for reinventing himself, he still feels that initial pang of being alone in a new location. Steve wants an easier way to meet new people, but also maintain a level of privacy by controlling what other people can see about him.

Persona 2:
Name: Sunpetal
Occupation: Unemployed/free-soul
Personality Type: Type-B Extravert

Sunpetal is what some would call a hippy. She is constantly going to parties, festivals and conventions and at times is an organizer, albeit an unofficial one, of some of the events at said festivals. 
She always wants to get a group going to do some kind of activity, like getting a drum circle going or starting a game of Catan, but she hates having to actively notify people around her of what she has planned and would prefer a way that she can set some kind of signal that can notify people of her intent.

Persona 3:
Name: Gregory
Occupation: Networker
Personality Type:Type-A Extravert

Greg is the kind of guy that makes things happen, but in order to do so he has to meet the people that will makes those things happen. Greg is constantly on the lookout for new talent that can help him. With a pocket full of business cards, he’s always itching to give out his contact information to whoever is interested. Greg needs a streamlined method to send out his contact information so that he can stop carrying so many business cards around and easily follow up with people that he’s shared contact info with.

Persona 4:
Name: Rebecca
Occupation: Writer
Personality Type: Type-A Introvert

Rebecca comes off as a shy individual due to her quiet demeanor, when in fact if you hit the right topic, she will talk your ear off. She is the kind of person that abhors small talk. She wants to get down to the nitty gritty and delve into a meaningful conversation, not waste time and energy talking about how cold it is today or how the trains always seem slower in the morning. 
For that reason she has trouble striking up conversations with people she doesn’t know because she doesn’t know what to talk to them about because she doesn’t know what her commonalities are with that person.

---Problem Statements---
How might we allow users to meet their neighbors.
How might help strangers organize.
How might we automate profile sharing.

——————————————

Problem Statement:

Introverts need a way to strike up conversations with strangers because they may happen to be their next best friend. 

Hypothesis:

I believe that by using proximity based profile sharing for introverts we will help alleviate social anxiety. 
We will know this to be true if otherwise shy individuals strike up conversations with strangers based on something they read in that stranger’s profile.

———————————————

Problem Statement:

Jobseekers/Networkers need a way to pass along their contact information easily because business cards are dated.

Hypothesis:

I believe that proximity based profile sharing can streamline giving and getting contact/profile information. 
We will know those to be true if my app is repurposed to share information professionally instead of socially.

———————————————

Problem Statement:

Organizers need a way to spontaneously start events with strangers because that would make the world more entertaining.

Hypothesis:
I believe with proximity based messaging organizers will be able to get the attention and cooperation of interested individuals who otherwise would have not known of the event. 
We will know this to be true when people get activities started by using SoapBox Messages.
